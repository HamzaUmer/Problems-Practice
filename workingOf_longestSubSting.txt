Length of String is 7 "abcabcbb"

Firstly when loop start value of start, end & maxLength:
start = 0
end = 0
maxLength = 0

Then, Set will store "abc" from "abcabcbb" now value would be :
start = 0 
end = 2 (because "a" on "0" index, "b" on "1" index and "c" on "2" index, so value of end is 2)
maxLength = 3;

Now, "a" repeated from "abcabcbb", so "a" from start would be delete and new string would be "bcabcbb":
start = 1
end = 3
maxLength = 3

Now again one more alphabet repeat which is "b" so this alphabet deleted from start again so "cabcbb":
start = 2
end = 4
maxLength = 3

Now again one more alphabet repeat which is "c" so this alphabet deleted from start again so "abcbb":
start = 3
end = 5
maxLength = 3

Now again "b" repeated so it would deleted again, so "abcb":
start = 4
end = 6
maxLength = 3

Finally one more repeated alphabet which is "b" so it would delete again and final window is "abc" which would store in set:
start = 5
end = 7
maxLength = 3

So, Output would be "3"..
